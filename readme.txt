Schedule email reminders. Enter your reminder, where you'd like to email the reminder to, and when you'd like the reminder to be sent.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to send email reminders to any email address on the date and time that you specify. So, basically, all you have to do is to enter your reminder, enter the email address you'd like to send the reminder to, and when you'd like the reminder to be sent. 

That's it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The reminder does not get sent on the exact date and time or the reminder is not sent at all =

The plugin uses WordPress cron scheduler (WP Cron) to periodically check for reminders to be sent. Unfortunately, WP Cron is not a real cron scheduler like the one found in Linux operating systems which can run commands and scripts on time. WP Cron depends on users visiting your web site in order to trigger WP Cron. This means that by default, reminders won't always get sent on the exact time you want. This is most noticeable on sites with very low traffic.

But, there is a way to work around this problem by leveraging real Linux cron instead. Find out how by [reading this tutorial](http://pogidude.com/2011/use-linux-cron-to-trigger-wordpress-cron-scheduler/)

= I don't see the reminder on my inbox =

Check in your spam folder. Sometimes, email messages are marked as spam by your email provider especially if this is the first time you've used the plugin.
